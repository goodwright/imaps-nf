  Annotates genome segments that are not annotated by iCount segmentation.

  When performing iCount segmentation on GTF annotation, the whole genome is
  split into the following genomic regions: CDS, UTR3, UTR5, ncRNA, intron,
  intergenic.

  If the segmentation is performed on filtered genomic annotation, some regions
  remain unnanotated.

  This is due to the fact that the annotation on a "gene" level covers all
  transcripts related to this gene, including transcripts with low
  transcript_support_level, which were removed by filtering. As a result, we get
  unannotated regions, which are covered by a gene, but lack transcripts that
  are required for segmentation.

  This module finds unannotated regions in the iCount genomic segment
  (regions.gtf), annotates them according to the corresponding gene, and adds
  them to the original segment under the feature "genic_other".
