        Pysam is a python module for reading and manipulating files in the
        SAM/BAM format. The SAM/BAM format is a way to store efficiently large
        numbers of alignments, such as those routinely created by
        next-generation sequencing methods. Pysam is a lightweight wrapper of
        the samtools C-API. Pysam also includes an interface for tabix.
